Treehouse SMP is a seasonal, public Minecraft server. Treehouse enters a new season with every major update, where the world will be reset to give everyone a blank canvas to build upon.

We welcome anyone who wants to hang out and play some Minecraft with us! Just make sure you follow the set of [rules](/rules). With that said, you can find instructions on how to join the server on the [Join SMP](/smp) page.

Treehouse SMP is run out of the pocket of the host, Hazel. They are not currently accepting donations for the maintenance of the server.

We hope to see you soon! ❤️
