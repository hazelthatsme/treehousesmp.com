# Rules
## Server Rules
The Server Rules are a set of rules that apply only to gameplay on the Treehouse SMP Minecraft server.
1. Griefing, as in the large-scale destruction of another's creations, is strictly forbidden. Violation results in a permanent ban.
2. The creation of automated farms requires approval by staff before construction. Violation results in the removal of the build\*.
3. Use of normally inaccessible areas (e.g. the Nether roof) for building is forbidden. Violation results in the removal of the build\*.
4. The creation of builds presenting excessively mature or offensive themes\*\* (e.g. depictions of genitalia, controversial symbolism, etc.) is forbidden. Violation results in the removal of the build\* and a warning.

\* When a build is removed due to a violation, items used in its construction will not be refunded.

\*\* "Excessively mature" or "offensive" may be redefined on a case-by-case basis.

## Community Guidelines
The Community Guidelines are a set of guidelines that apply to all communication on both the Treehouse SMP Minecraft server and the Treehouse SMP Discord server.
1. Discrimination of any form is strictly forbidden. Violation results in a permanent, appealable ban.
2. The use of slurs, as in words used with the express intent to discriminate, is forbidden. Violation results in a permanent, appealable ban.

## Warnings
Violation of some rules will result in players receiving warnings. Players may amass three warnings without any consequences to their ability to play on Treehouse SMP. When a rule is violated after the player has amassed three warnings, they will be permanently banned from the server. At the end of a season, any players who are not banned due to consecutive warnings, will lose one warning from their record.

## Revisions
Rules may be revised by staff at any time. It is your responsibility to keep up to date with the current set of rules.
